# Zoolander CI
Zoolander CI is a minimalist CI environment for illumos-based projects, or
cross-platform projects that can reasonably be tested on illumos.

This repository is capable of bootstrapping and deploying itself, assuming you
have valid AWS credentials and sufficient privileges to create and manage EC2
instance, images, and security groups.

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details.
